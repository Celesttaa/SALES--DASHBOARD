Your goals define the growth of your business. Without setting ambitious, actionable goals, your business stays stuck in limbo—coasting along, but never improving. Goals often act like a roadmap through time.
# What is SALES--DASHBOARD?
A dashboard is sales tech that provides a visual representation of your most recent performance metrics. It gives you a concise view of results-based data like sales-to-date, sales-by-region, lead conversion rate, sales growth, etc.


Tracking sales metrics in real-time means reps and managers can view their performance as it’s happening. With this information displayed in a pleasing, simple-to-process visual layout, they can stay on track and reach their quotas more easily.

The two primary benefits of the rep performance dashboard, however, are improved rep coaching and enhanced customer experience.

When managers can clearly compare rep performances based on hard numbers, they’re able to pinpoint areas where multiple reps are struggling. One of the challenges when developing successful sales coaching techniques is figuring out what agents actually need coaching on. The sales rep performance dashboard succinctly highlights areas of success and struggle, allowing managers to create targeted pieces of training with real impact.

Meanwhile, as reps improve, so does the customer experience. Not only do prospects and customers benefit from better-trained reps, but they also benefit from reps who are aware of their entire pipeline. By tracking metrics like “open deals,” the rep performance dashboard lets reps know when they’ve left prospects hanging for too long. This awareness means reps are more likely to reconnect with prospects in a timely manner, thus increasing nurture and conversion success rates.
